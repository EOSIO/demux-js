/* ObjectActionHandler
 * This is an example of an AbstractActionHandler implementation.
 *
 * The role of the Action Handler is to receive block data passed from the Action Reader, and populate some external
 * state deterministically derived from that data, as well as trigger side-effects.
 *
 * The AbstractActionHandler has the following abstract methods:
 *
 * handleWithState(handle)
 *   Call the passed-in `handle` function with the object you would like to pass in as `state` to Updaters and Effects.
 *   In this example, we're just using a simple structured Javascript object, but in a real implementation this will
 *   most likely an interface to a database. See the API documentation for more details.
 *
 * updateIndexState(state, block)
 *   Besides some caching optimizations, the state of the progress of indexing is stored outside of Demux itself, and
 *   this method is implemented to store that data. The data needed to be stored is blockNumber, blockHash, isReplay,
 *   and handlerVersionName. the `state` object passed into the `handle` function of the above `handleWithState` is
 *   provided here as a convenience.
 *
 * loadIndexState()
 *   This returns an `IndexState` object containing all the information saved in the above method.
 *
 * rollbackTo(blockNumber)
 *   If indexing potentially reversible blocks, a mechanism for reverting back to a specific block is necessary.
 *   In this example, we keep a history of the entire state at every block, and load it when called.
